# General Information

This project has been in development for a long time and already offers many features despite its small size. If you wipe a computer you might be annoyed by reinstalling tools manually‚Äî**aut0 mak3r** solves this problem for you.

Modules such as `full_config` install and configure many components automatically. "The maker" was the original name, so the logo remains. If you encounter any errors, please visit the [Bug Report](#bug-report) section. Feel free to request additional Termux tools.

# Disclaimer

  Use this tool for educational purposes only. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  If you perform any illegal attacks, I am not responsible for your actions.
  Use this tool correctly, and do not re-upload it to your GitHub repository without permission.

# Installation

  For Linux/Termux:
  
  ```git clone https://github.com/rebl0x3r/aut0_mak3r.git```
  
  ```cd aut0_mak3r && chmod +x *```

Run:

```bash
bash tmaker.sh
```

**Warning:** The tool relies on several folders‚Äîdo not delete them!

- `backup` ‚Äì stores DNS and `.bashrc` backups
- `lib` ‚Äì libraries and other module tools (can be run manually)
- `openvpn` ‚Äì login configurations and modules such as `openvpn.sh`
- `tools` ‚Äì placeholder for future tools

## Modules

The launcher scans the `modules` directory and loads every `*.sh` file. Each
module can optionally set two variables that describe it:

```bash
MODULE_NAME="example"
MODULE_DESC="Example module description"
```

If these variables are provided, their values appear in the menu. The script
should also define a `run` function that performs the module action. New tools
become available simply by dropping a compatible file into `modules/`.

The `install_tools` module provides a menu-driven installer allowing automatic or manual installation of common tools.
